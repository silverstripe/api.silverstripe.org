RewriteEngine On

# If requested file is in the public/static folder, serve it
# This file detection + redirect done here rather than public/.htaccess as redirect to public/$1 will mean
# that %{REQUEST_URI} will change from something like /5/index.html to /public/5/index.html, which means
# that we can no longer use %{REQUEST_URI} to check that a static file exists using -f because the file
# is /public/static/6/index.html not /public/6/index.html
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/public/static/%{REQUEST_URI} -f
